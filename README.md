# draw-winning-candidates
This repo has a simple web application (d3.js, SVG, JavaScript) that allows you to draw winners in a fair, anonymous way - suitable for drawing from up to 12 candidates

Created for the Conclusion prize drawing ceremony for the Advent of Code 2023 (75 participants, six who had all puzzles solved correctly, two prizes to be awarded)

## ToDo

Nice to have's

- enter the names of the candidates into the page (now they are hard coded)
- use letters to mark the circles in the spinning wheel (make sure these letters are rotated to counter the wheel's rotation)
- use nicer fonts
